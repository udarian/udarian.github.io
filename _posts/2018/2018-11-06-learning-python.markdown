It is the first time i am learn `Python`, because i had an assignment on `Data Science` and `Data Analytics` class. I don't have any idea what should i do.

My lecturer said `Python` really easy to learn. Yep, it is really easy, even i am got headache everytime i thingking about "How the hell this code works?"

I think, i am need to write down every links of tutorials, usefull library, and usefull things that i found during learning `Python` throught internet.

Hopefully it can help me (or also it may help you) to find them again if needed someday, because bookmarks feature on my browser doesn't works for me.
